### Part 1: Use an ARM template to deploy a new Active Directory domain with sample data
### Shout-out to @GoateePFE for the initial work on the code for Part 1.

### Log into your Azure subscription and open a PowerShell cloud shell session.
### Clone this repo down to your clouddrive.

### Modify the below powershell code blocks as necessary and execute on the command line
### Adjust the 'yournamehere' part of these three strings to
### something unique for you.

    Follow the instructions in .\ADDS-with-Data\CallingScript.ps1

### Once the deployment completes, you can RDP into your new domain controller


# Part 2: Use an ARM template to create a new vnet in another region and peer with the vnet from Part 1

### Switch your cloud shell session to Bash
### Navigate to /2019-Global-Azure-Bootcamp/vnet-vnet-peering
### Execute the following shell scripts.
### This process takes less than a minute for each shell script to execute

### The first shell script uses the Azure CLI to create an ARM deployment to create the new vnet in the EAST US Region
sh deploy-new-vnet.sh

### The second shell script uses the Azure CLI to create an ARM deployment to peer the new vnet with the existing vnet from Part 1
sh deploy-vnet-peering.sh

# Part 3: Use Terraform to deploy a new Active Directory domain controller in the new vnet from Part 1

### Continue using or refresh your Bash cloud shell session
### Navigate to 2019-Global-Azure-Bootcamp/CreateADReplicaDC

### Edit the CreateADReplicaDC.tfvars file.  Validate all values match as instructed in the file.

### Initialize your terraform workspace to ensure you have the correct resources to use the AzureRM provider
terraform init

### Validate your template by creating a terraform plan.  Ensure there are no errors returned
terraform plan --var-file="CreateADReplicaDC.tfvars"

### Deploy your new Active Directory domain controller(s).  
### This process takes about 15-20 minutes.
terraform apply --var-file="CreateADReplicaDC.tfvars"

### You will be promted to type 'yes' to validate you wish to continue
### Once your deployment completes, you can RDP into your new domain controllers from the one created in Part 1.
### Check the AD Users & Computers MMC to view the new domain controllers in the "Domain Controllers" container in AD
