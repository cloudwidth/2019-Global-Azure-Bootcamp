### Part 1: Use an ARM template to deploy a new Active Directory domain with sample data
### Shout-out to @GoateePFE for the initial work on the code for Part 1.

#Log into your Azure subscription and open a PowerShell cloud shell session.
#Clone this repo down to your clouddrive.

# Modify the below powershell code blocks as necessary and execute on the command line
# Adjust the 'yournamehere' part of these three strings to
# something unique for you.

    $URI       = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudwidth/ADDS-with-Data/master/active-directory-new-domain-with-data/azuredeploy.json'
    $Location  = 'South Central US'
    $rgname    = 'yournamehere'
    $namePrefix = 'yournamehere'                    # cannot start with numbers
    $addnsName = ($namePrefix).ToLower()            # Lowercase required

# Check that the public dns $addnsName is available

    if (Test-AzDnsAvailability -DomainNameLabel $addnsName -Location $Location)
    { 'Available' } else { 'Taken. addnsName must be globally unique.' }


# Create the new resource group. Runs quickly.
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgname -Location $Location

# Parameters for the template and configuration
$MyParams = @{
    location              = $Location
    domainName            = ($namePrefix + ".com")       # The maximum length is 15 characters
    addnsName             = $addnsName
    namePrefix            = $namePrefix
   }

# Splat the parameters on New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment  
$SplatParams = @{
    TemplateUri             = $URI 
    ResourceGroupName       = $rgname 
    TemplateParameterObject = $MyParams
    Name                    = ($namePrefix + 'Forest')
   }

# Deploy the ARM templates with the PowerShell command below
# You will be prompted for the domain admin password (REMEMBER THIS FOR PART 3 BELOW)
# Default domain administrator username is 'adadministrator'
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment @SplatParams -Verbose

# Once the deployment completes, you can RDP into your new domain controller


### Part 2: Use an ARM template to create a new vnet in another region and peer with the vnet from Part 1

# Switch your cloud shell session to Bash
# Navigate to /2019-Global-Azure-Bootcamp/vnet-vnet-peering
# Execute the following shell scripts.
# This process takes less than a minute for each shell script to execute

# The first shell script uses the Azure CLI to create an ARM deployment to create the new vnet in the EAST US Region
sh deploy-new-vnet.sh

# The second shell script uses the Azure CLI to create an ARM deployment to peer the new vnet with the existing vnet from Part 1
sh deploy-vnet-peering.sh

### Part 3: Use Terraform to deploy a new Active Directory domain controller in the new vnet from Part 1

# Continue using or refresh your Bash cloud shell session
# Navigate to 2019-Global-Azure-Bootcamp/CreateADReplicaDC

# Edit the CreateADReplicaDC.tfvars file.  Validate all values match as instructed in the file.

# Initialize your terraform workspace to ensure you have the correct resources to use the AzureRM provider
terraform init

# Validate your template by creating a terraform plan.  Ensure there are no errors returned
terraform plan --var-file="CreateADReplicaDC.tfvars"

# Deploy your new Active Directory domain controller(s).  
# This process takes about 15-20 minutes.
terraform apply --var-file="CreateADReplicaDC.tfvars"

# You will be promted to type 'yes' to validate you wish to continue
# Once your deployment completes, you can RDP into your new domain controllers from the one created in Part 1.
# Check the AD Users & Computers MMC to view the new domain controllers in the "Domain Controllers" container in AD
